Pro_Act provides you with an efficient way of managing your tasks. It works on the principals of divide and conquer, allows the user to enter tasks and then divide them into further sub-tasks and handle them efficiently!
Best when working with team to be updated about the tasks that are completed and those that are yet to be done.
